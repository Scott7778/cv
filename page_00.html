    <ol start="7">
      <li>The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul;
        The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple;</li>
      <li>The statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart;
        The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;</li>
      <li>The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever;
        The judgments of the Lord are true and <a href="http://jesus-abc.com/">righteous altogether</a>.</li>
      <li>More to be desired are they than gold,
        Yea, than much fine gold;
        Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.</li>
      <li>Moreover by them Your servant is warned, And in keeping them there is great reward.</li>
